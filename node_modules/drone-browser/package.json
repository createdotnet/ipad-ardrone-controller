  "readme": "Getting started\n======\nConnect to your ar drone 2 via WLAN, then run node.server.js open up localhost:3001 and you're ready to go.\n\nUse `W, A, S, D` to move front, back and sideways. Use your `cursors` to go up/down or turn clockwise/counter clockwise.\nSome animations can be triggered with `1-4`\n`SPACE` for taking of and `esc` for landing.\n\nWhen you crash use `e` to recover from emergency mode.\n\nThis project is heavily inspired from https://github.com/usefulthink/nodecopter-monitor . I just removed the three.js part and ported it from socket.io to faye since I like that better.\n\nDependencies\n=======\nYou can install/update the node dependencies via `npm install -d`.\nDependencies for client code are managed via bower ( https://github.com/twitter/bower ). \nYou need to have `ffmpeg` installed (it's used for the picture stuff)\n\nScreenshot\n========\nThis is how it looks like in action:\n![drone browser in chrome](https://raw.github.com/functino/drone-browser/master/screenshot.png)\n\nTODO\n======\n- use getUserMedia/the webcam to control the drone (like magic xylophone...)\n- add a slider to make the speed/duration of actions configurable\n- toggle between takeoff/land buttons or disable takeoff button after takeoff...\n- mayby change the \"recover\" button to send a land command first (because otherwise the drone tries to start again...)\n- only show the recover button when the drone is in emergency mode\n- use canvas to draw angle-stuff or rotate the picture stream accordingly\n- get rid of the (sometimes) long lag of the picture stream \n- makte it work without ffmpeg (skip the picture stuff then....)",
