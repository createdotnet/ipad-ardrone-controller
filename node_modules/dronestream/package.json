This is\nmostly a h264 baseline video, but adds custom framing. These frames are parsed\nand mostly disposed of. The remaining h264 payload is split into NAL units and\nsent to the browser via web sockets.\n\nIn the browser broadway takes care of the rendering of the WebGL canvas.\n\n## Status\n\nFor this release I was exclusively interested in the lowest possible latency.\nThere is no error handling for the websockets, the connection to the drone or\nthe video player what-so-ever. This may come eventually, or may not. I think it\nis enough to be used as a starting point for your own integration.\n\n## Thanks\n\n- Triple high fives to Felix 'felixge' Geisendörfer for getting the whole\n  NodeCopter movement started and being extremely helpful in the process of\n  getting this together.\n\n- André 'zoddy' Kussmann for supplying the drone and allowing me to keep\n  hacking on it, even when he had to cancel the NodeCopter event for himself.\n\n- Michael Bebenita, Alon Zakai, Andreas Gal and Mathieu 'p01' Henri for the\n  magic of Broadway.js\n\n- Johann Phillip Strathausen for being a great team mate at NodeCopter 2012\n  Berlin.\n\n- Brian Leroux for being not content with the original solution and for\n  cleaning up the predecessor, nodecopter-stream.\n\n",
