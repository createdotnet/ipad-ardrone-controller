h1. node_mdns

h2. Synopsis

node_mdns is a "node.js":/ry/node add-on. It adds support for multicast DNS service discovery, also known as zeroconf or bonjour.

It provides an object-oriented interface to announce and browse services.

Internally, it uses the mDNSResponder API which is available on all major platforms.

h2. Build

Tested on Mac OS X and Linux. I keep getting reports that it works on (Open-) Solaris, too. On Linux the avahi dns_sd compat library is required.

bc. node-waf configure build

TODO: install?

h2. Quickstart

p. To import the add-on use something like this:

bc. var mdns = require('mdns');

p. Announce a TCP server on port 4321 with service type 'http':

bc.. var ad = mdns.createAdvertisement('http', 4321, 'tcp');
ad.start();

setTimeout(function() { ad.stop(); }, 10000);

p. Browse HTTP servers:

bc.. var browser = mdns.createBrowser('http', 'tcp');
browser.addListener('serviceUp', function(info) { puts('found', info); });
browser.addListener('serviceDown', function(info) { puts('gone', info); });
browser.start();
